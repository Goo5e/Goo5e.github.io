			<h1>Alternative GPU uses
			<h2>Graphics are the most common use of a GPU but in recent years people have begun to use the immense parallel computing power of GPUs for tasks other than 3D Graphics, basically, any task that can be split into enough smaller parallel tasks can be sped up by the usage of GPU processing. As, like for graphics, running many limited instruction set cores at the same time can also benefit many other tasks that are getting increasingly more important. 
			</p>

			<h2>For example in machine learning you must train your algorithm many hundreds of times with slight variations to make your algorithm as accurate as possible, each test to train a possible variation is a self-contained calculation and so can be run in parallel. Thus if you want to train an algorithm, with a CPU you can test only a handful of variations at once while a GPU will be able to test thousands at the same time.<br><br>GPU processing can also be used for some malicious uses. In the case of brute force attacks on passwords, the tasks being carried out are very simple and completely parallel (just testing if a string of characters works as the password) and so can be sped up massively by running the calculation on a GPU. E.g. if you wanted to crack a number lock with a 7 digit passcode, there would be 9999999 possible passcodes. This would take an 8 core CPU about 1.25 million clock cycles while a GPU with 4,000 cores could do it in around 2500. Even with each GPU core being significantly slower than each CPU core this will give a massive reduction in the time the calculation will take.
