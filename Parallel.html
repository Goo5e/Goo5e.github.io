			<h1>Parallel Systems
			<h2>The general concept of running multiple calculations of a program at a time is known as parallel computing, it gives a boost in processing speed by splitting a complex problem into many smaller ones that can be handled separately at the same time. This idea is not limited to use in GPUs and a parallel system may be run by multiple processors within a computer, or even multiple devices across a network, anything where the workload can be split without depending on the other outputs.  
			</p>
			<p>
			<u>Advantages</u><br>
			 <ul>
                    <li>This process can increase speeds of parallel tasks to a great degree.</li>
					<li>The system can output more data per cycle.</li>
              </ul>
			<u>Disadvantages</u><br>
			 <ul>
                    <li>Parallel systems are usually harder to program.</li>
					<li>They are usually more power-intensive than non-parallel alternatives.</li>
					<li>They cannot speed up (or could even slow down) tasks that are not parallel.</li>
              </ul>
